# Weather

This is a simple python script that grabs weather data from OpenWeatherAPI and displays it on the command line in a user-friendly way.

Important Note: I have omitted the Api key, you must supply a OpenWeatherApi key at the top of the config.py file

1) Run the script with: python ./weather.py
2) Enter a US zip code (hit enter)

And there you have it!
